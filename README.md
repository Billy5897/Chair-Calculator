This is a first draft of a Python app for production environments.
The target is to check existing stock levels and determine the quantity of products that can be produced from it.
The product of choice to get this started is a simple task chair.

Targeted project milestones:
1. Store a simplified stock overview as a dictionary and calculate production possibilities from there
2. Extend the stock dictionary to a bill of materials with stock numbers. Take user input to a configuration that shall be produced
3. Externally store the bill of material and stock in a csv file and import it for the calculation
4. Make purchasing recommendations to produce more
5. Include value of goods to determine used up stock vs. cost of additional material
